# Travlr Getaways Travel Booking Website README
## Introduction 
Travlr Getaways is a travel agency that has requested a web application to enable its customers to book travel packages, create an account, search for travel packages, and view their itineraries. The application also has an admin-only site to allow Travlr Getaways administrators to manage customers, travel packages, and pricing. The application was built using the MEAN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js.

## Architecture
In this project, we used Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) for the frontend development. Express was used as the web application framework to handle the various HTTP requests from the client-side, while HTML and JavaScript were used to design the user interface and implement client-side functionality. The SPA was used to provide seamless navigation between different sections of the application without reloading the page.

For the backend, we used a NoSQL MongoDB database. This was because a NoSQL database like MongoDB provides the flexibility and scalability required for modern web applications. With a NoSQL database, we can easily store and retrieve data in JSON format, making it easier to integrate with the frontend.

## Functionality
JSON, short for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data between the frontend and backend of a web application. Unlike JavaScript, which is a programming language, JSON is a data format that is easy to read and write for both humans and machines. JSON ties together the frontend and backend development pieces by providing a common format for data exchange.

In the full stack development process, we refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies by creating reusable UI components. These reusable components made it easier to add new features to the application without having to write new code from scratch. By reducing the amount of code we had to write, we saved time and improved the overall performance of the application.

## Testing
API testing involves various methods for request and retrieval, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, among others. Endpoints, on the other hand, are the URLs through which the client can access different parts of the API. Testing with added layers of security can be difficult because it requires additional steps, such as authentication and authorization, to ensure that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application.

In this project, we tested the endpoints using different methods to ensure that the API was working as expected. We also added security features, such as authentication and authorization, to protect the application from unauthorized access.

## Reflection
Upon enrolling in this capstone course at SNHU, I had high expectations for the quality of instruction and resources. However, I was ultimately disappointed by the quality of the instructions and outdated resources. The program appeared hastily thrown together, and I found it to be confusing and unhelpful. As a result, I cannot say that this course provided any significant value to my professional goals.

Despite the challenges, I was able to gain valuable hands-on experience in full-stack web development through a Udemy course. This project allowed me to learn how to use various frontend and backend technologies, including Express HTML, JavaScript, Angular, and MongoDB, among others. I also became familiar with different tools and frameworks, such as Node.js and Angular CLI, which helped improve the performance and scalability of web applications.

While I regret that the course fell short of my expectations, I am grateful for the knowledge and skills I have gained from this experience. I believe that this project showcases my proficiency in full-stack development and highlights my ability to build web applications using the MEAN stack. Moving forward, I am confident that the skills I have developed through this experience will make me a more competitive candidate in my career field.
