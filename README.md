# Travlr Getaways Travel Booking Website README
## Introduction 
Travlr Getaways is a travel agency that has requested a web application to enable its customers to book travel packages, create an account, search for travel packages, and view their itineraries. The application also has an admin-only site to allow Travlr Getaways administrators to manage customers, travel packages, and pricing. The application was built using the MEAN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js.

## Architecture
In this project, we used Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) for the frontend development. Express was used as the web application framework to handle the various HTTP requests from the client-side, while HTML and JavaScript were used to design the user interface and implement client-side functionality. The SPA was used to provide seamless navigation between different sections of the application without reloading the page.

For the backend, we used a NoSQL MongoDB database. This was because a NoSQL database like MongoDB provides the flexibility and scalability required for modern web applications. With a NoSQL database, we can easily store and retrieve data in JSON format, making it easier to integrate with the frontend.

## Functionality
JSON, short for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data between the frontend and backend of a web application. Unlike JavaScript, which is a programming language, JSON is a data format that is easy to read and write for both humans and machines. JSON ties together the frontend and backend development pieces by providing a common format for data exchange.

In the full stack development process, we refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies by creating reusable UI components. These reusable components made it easier to add new features to the application without having to write new code from scratch. By reducing the amount of code we had to write, we saved time and improved the overall performance of the application.

## Testing
API testing involves various methods for request and retrieval, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, among others. Endpoints, on the other hand, are the URLs through which the client can access different parts of the API. Testing with added layers of security can be difficult because it requires additional steps, such as authentication and authorization, to ensure that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application.

In this project, we tested the endpoints using different methods to ensure that the API was working as expected. We also added security features, such as authentication and authorization, to protect the application from unauthorized access.
